          <h2 class="mb-4 dark:text-night-heading-text-green">Background</h2>
          <p class="text-xl">Born in Zagreb, Croatia, I'm 29 years old and my journey in software development has been a whirlwind of
            busy
            days, fun experiences, and fascinating moments. As a kid, I always liked to play with free random software
            apps
            that were included as free trials on monthly PC magazine subscription CDs. When I was 13 years old, I began
            teaching myself Photoshop and embarked on the exciting journey of creating custom free blog templates for a
            local blogging platform.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-8 mb-5 mt-5">
        <div class="col-span-7 md:col-span-5 md:col-start-2 xl:col-span-3 xl:col-start-2">
          <p class="mb-4">
            Later, I shifted to platforms like Joomla, WordPress, and PHPBB. I created web portal & forum where I shared
            small tutorials about web design, photoshop and all IT related topics.
            In our best days we had approx 500 unique daily users, hosting and domain cost was sponsored by local web
            hosting company, and website was featured in local computers magazine.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">By 2012, things took a big turn. I decided to go to IT University to study web design and programming. To
            pay
            for my studies, I took on a full-time job in a massive brewery as a warehouse operator and forklift driver â€“
            quite the balancing act!
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">In my second year at university, a remarkable programming professor altered the course of my journey. Their
            teaching method and engaging projects in the C language ignited my passion for programming, a fervor that
            continues to drive me. Recognizing my dedication, my professor's valuable recommendation subsequently
            secured
            my
            first full-time web development position at a renowned software agency.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">After about three awesome years at the agency, I craved new experiences. So, I packed my bags and headed to
            Amsterdam to join a startup. Although my time there was short, I got a taste of the exciting startup scene.
            This
            decision marked the beginning of my journey into the world of entrepreneurship, as I started contracting
            after
            working for the agency full-time. Embracing the challenges and opportunities that came with freelancing, I
            honed
            my skills and expanded my network, all while maintaining the same passion that initially led me to the
            agency.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">My next project was in Frankfurt, Germany, for one of the biggest banks in Europe, bringing with me the
            invaluable experience of leading a dynamic team in the creation of a foundational in-house library. This
            library
            served as the bedrock for all their cutting-edge web applications, streamlining development processes and
            ensuring consistency across the digital landscape.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">After a fulfilling year in Frankfurt, my path guided me to Berlin, where I partnered with a dynamic
            medium-sized SaaS (software as a service) company for my next project. Their remarkable product had
            captivated
            the attention of some of the largest companies across Europe, who relied on it for their operations.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            I returned to Zagreb as the pandemic started, seeking the comfort of my hometown. When the lockdown was
            lifted,
            a
            new opportunity emerged. I decided to take the initiative and establish a shared workspace right in the
            heart of
            the city's historic area. It's been an exciting journey as I've transformed this space into a hub for
            creativity
            and collaboration. What makes it even more special is that I'm not alone in this venture â€“ a close-knit
            group of
            my friends, who also happen to be skilled software development professionals, joined me. Together, we've
            been
            shaping ideas, bringing projects to life, and nurturing a sense of camaraderie that goes beyond mere
            workspace
            interactions. As time has gone by, our co-working haven has become a place where our passions blend
            seamlessly
            with our daily work. And so, to this day, you can still find us here in the heart of Zagreb, working
            together,
            learning from one another, and making our mark on the software development landscape.
