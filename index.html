            in life, less is often more. More code, more problems! ðŸ˜‰

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Born in Zagreb, Croatia, I'm 29 years old and my journey in software development has been a whirlwind of busy
          days, fun experiences, and fascinating moments. As a kid, I always liked to play with free random software
          apps
          that were included as free trials on monthly PC magazine subscription CDs. When I was 13 years old, I began
          teaching myself Photoshop and embarked on the exciting journey of creating custom free blog templates for a
          local blogging platform.</p>
        <p>
          Later, I shifted to platforms like Joomla, WordPress, and PHPBB. I created web portal & forum where I shared
          small tutorials about web design, photoshop and all IT related topics.
          In our best days we had approx 500 unique daily users, hosting and domain cost was sponsored by local web
          hosting company, and website was featured in local computers magazine.
        </p>
        <p>By 2012, things took a big turn. I decided to go to IT University to study web design and programming. To pay
          for my studies, I took on a full-time job in a massive brewery as a warehouse operator and forklift driver â€“
          quite the balancing act!
        </p>
        <p>In my second year at university, a remarkable programming professor altered the course of my journey. Their
          teaching method and engaging projects in the C language ignited my passion for programming, a fervor that
          continues to drive me. Recognizing my dedication, my professor's valuable recommendation subsequently secured
          my
          first full-time web development position at a renowned software agency.
        </p>
        <p>After about three awesome years at the agency, I craved new experiences. So, I packed my bags and headed to
          Amsterdam to join a startup. Although my time there was short, I got a taste of the exciting startup scene.
          This
          decision marked the beginning of my journey into the world of entrepreneurship, as I started contracting after
          working for the agency full-time. Embracing the challenges and opportunities that came with freelancing, I
          honed
          my skills and expanded my network, all while maintaining the same passion that initially led me to the agency.
        </p>
        <p>My next project was in Frankfurt, Germany, for one of the biggest banks in Europe, bringing with me the
          invaluable experience of leading a dynamic team in the creation of a foundational in-house library. This
          library
          served as the bedrock for all their cutting-edge web applications, streamlining development processes and
          ensuring consistency across the digital landscape.
        </p>
        <p>After a fulfilling year in Frankfurt, my path guided me to Berlin, where I partnered with a dynamic
          medium-sized SaaS (software as a service) company for my next project. Their remarkable product had captivated
          the attention of some of the largest companies across Europe, who relied on it for their operations.
        </p>
        <p>
        I returned to Zagreb as the pandemic started, seeking the comfort of my hometown. When the lockdown was lifted,
        a
        new opportunity emerged. I decided to take the initiative and establish a shared workspace right in the heart of
        the city's historic area. It's been an exciting journey as I've transformed this space into a hub for creativity
        and collaboration. What makes it even more special is that I'm not alone in this venture â€“ a close-knit group of
        my friends, who also happen to be skilled software development professionals, joined me. Together, we've been
        shaping ideas, bringing projects to life, and nurturing a sense of camaraderie that goes beyond mere workspace
        interactions. As time has gone by, our co-working haven has become a place where our passions blend seamlessly
        with our daily work. And so, to this day, you can still find us here in the heart of Zagreb, working together,
        learning from one another, and making our mark on the software development landscape.
