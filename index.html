        <h1>Antonio Rabuzin</h1>
        <p>Versatile Senior/Lead Software Developer | 10+ years of professional experience in web development.</p>
        <p>

          My journey in software development has been a whirlwind of busy days, fun experiences, and fascinating moments. It all started when I was just 13 years old in 2006. Back then, I began teaching myself web design and had a blast creating custom blog designs for fun. Later, I shifted to platforms like Joomla, WordPress, and PHPBB. I created web portal & forum where I shared small tutorials about web design, photoshop and all IT related topics. In our best days we had approx 500 unique daily users, hosting and domain cost was sponsored by local web hosting company, and website was featured in local computers magazine

By 2012, things took a big turn. I decided to go to IT University to study web design and programming. To pay for my studies, I took on a full-time job in a massive brewery as a warehouse operator and forklift driver â€“ quite the balancing act!

During my second year at university, a remarkable programming professor changed the game. Their teaching style and the cool stuff we did with the C language got me hooked on programming. This passion still drives me today. Not only did this professor help me land my first full-time programming gig at a web development agency, but they also gave me a shot at helping out practically at the university because I rocked a test.

After about three awesome years at the agency, I craved new experiences. So, I packed my bags and headed to Amsterdam to join a startup. Although my time there was short, I got a taste of the exciting startup scene. But then, I was off to Frankfurt, Germany, to join Deutsche Bank, a big and well-known company.

After a little over a year in Frankfurt I moved to Berlin and joined medium-sized SaaS (software as a service) company. They've got this really cool product, and they work with many of the biggest companies in Europe. The goal is to grow even more and become a big enterprise.

When pandemic started I moved back home to Zagreb. Right after lockdown I formed a co-working space in the historic center of Zagreb which I share with few other like minded software development professionals and good friends.

I've been lucky to work in all sorts of places â€“ from agencies and schools to startups and big corporations. I've tackled different projects, served different audiences, and dabbled in different parts of the tech world. All of this has given me a pretty unique way of looking at problems and coming up with solutions that stand out.
